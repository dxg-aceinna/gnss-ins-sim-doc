### 2.1 Coordinate frames

#### 2.1.1 ECEF frame
The ECEF frame is an Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed reference system. Its origin is the Earthâ€™s CoM. Its z axis points to the true north. Its x axis points to the intersection of the Greenwich meridian and the equator, and its y axis complete the right-handed coordinate frame. We use the WGS-84 reference ellipsoid in the simulation since it is used in GPS.
Obviously, the ECEF is not an inertial reference system.

#### 2.1.2 NED frame
For a device near or on the surface of the Earth, it is more convenient to describe its motion (especially rotations) relative the NED (North-East-Downward) or ENU (East-North-Upward) frame. We choose the NED frame in gnss-ins-imu.
Its origin is fixed at the device. Its x axis is in the local horizontal plane and point to the true north. Its z axis is perpendicular to the local horizontal plane and point downwards, and its y axis completes the right-handed coordinate frame.
